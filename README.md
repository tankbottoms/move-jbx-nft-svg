# Movement, Juicebox Project NFT

Juicebox and Movement research for an entirely composed SVG NFT with sufficient diversity to be used as a a project NFT, or Genesis NFT where the SVG animation, designs are diverse to be unique over 1,000 projects with 5,000 contributors each.

### Project NFT

The default project NFT for Juicebox issues a player-card like NFT with just the project id. The project metadata could be disabled by default so the SVG card would just be the background, Juicebox lower right logo, and potentially some SVG animated center piece such as the Merkaba, and project information animating around the edges.

While it is possible to imprint and store additional data about the project in the NFT, it would require storage, thus cost and no meaningful user benefit can be gleaned.

### Genesis NFT

Creating a library of SVG abstract shapes and center piece animations, and the Project Name, NFT / Token Count and a statement may be of interest if a Genesis NFT contract was created which would administer all project genesis collections. The center piece could be user configurable with either user uploadable SVG, or PNG which either stores metadata within the contract or generates the SVG assets and pushes to IPFS, then sets the CID.
